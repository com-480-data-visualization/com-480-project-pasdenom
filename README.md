### Technical aspects

For the implementation we used different tools :
* Bootstrap : For the website structure we used bootstrap. Using this framework we were able to present a responsive and dynamic interface.
* d3 : All our visualization are made with d3.js. We integrated an old version of the framework for a specific visualization because the example where we start was not with the last version and it could be painful to re-implement it from scratch.
* JQuery : Mandatory to be able to use bootstrap and d3.
* Python : For the processing of the dataset we used python. Different notebooks can be found on our git repository.
