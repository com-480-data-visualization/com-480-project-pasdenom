      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Cinema is certainly a well-known and well-established industry today, but do you know how it has started and how it has evolved? Do you want to find out which genres were the most popular in the 1960s or with which actors Woody Allen or Ridley Scott have worked?</p>
      <p>If so, this is the right place for you! Through various visualisations, we offer you a path through the history of cinema. Stay with us to discover the evolution of genres, and which actors and film directors have worked with who and on which genre. From the Lumière brothers’ short films to the latest blockbusters, thousands of people and movies have defined the history of the Seventh Art, as cinema is often referred to in France and Italy. </p>

      <div class="row viz" id="genres_viz">
        <h1>Genres</h1>
        <h2>Global view</h2>
        <p>Let’s dive in the multitude of genres cinema has offered us through time. We start our journey with a global view that shows the number of films produced of each genre by year. We encourage you to select a specific span of years to dive deeper in this evolution or to look at each genre, one of a time, by simply passing your mouse on the corresponding name in the legend. Double click to go back to the global view. You might discover some neat details such as the nearly vanishing of Western movies after the 1980s.</p>

        <h1>Career Peak of most prolific actors for each movie genre</h1>
        <p>Have you ever wondered who were the most prolific actors in the 1940s? By looking at the four most common film genres, we present to you the career peek of the most prominent actors. You can sort the visualisation either by time or by genre, depending on what you are interested in. If an actor appears on different genres, the specific genre is indicated. Hovering the bars will give you a more detailed view of the actor’s career span. Can you find the actor with the longest career span? How many years was it?</p>
