## Dataset

The main dataset we will use is The Movies Dataset, found at https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset/data#movies_metadata.csv. It is an ensemble of data collected from TMDB and GroupLens, offering various informations on 45000 movies including budget and revenues, production countries, actors and many other. A more detailed look at the dataset will be given in the data_processing notebook.
It is also worth mentioning this dataset comprehends a subset of ratings from 700 users on 9000 movies, only a small fraction of the full ratings dataset called The FullMovies Dataset (https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/). We don't know yet if we will explore this perspective on cinema but we think it is important to mention the availability of such a dataset (comprehending 27,000,000 ratings and 1,100,000 tag applications applied to 58,000 movies by 280,000 users).

## Problematic

Our goal is to explore the history of cinema and its evolution over time from multiple perspectives. Movies are not just the final product you watch at cinema or home on your TV but an entire industry connecting people from all around the world. In this project, we would like to explore this complexity by offering a pluridimensional view through time, from the beginning of cinema to the present days.

From a technical point of view, our goal is to offer an interactive experience where users can walk through time and observe the evolution of cinema from different point of view, focusing on just a small subset of movies, on a particular period of time or on a specific angle. The idea is to link the different visualizations between them to offer users more control on how they want to watch the Story of Cinema.

Our target audience would be anyone interested in cinema, even without having concrete knowledges. You are not required to have watched a lot of movies to understand and enjoye the experience we are offering but the ones who have will certainly be pleased to discover more about their passion.

## Exploratory data analysis

The exploratory data analysis will be conducted in more details in the dedicated notebook. Here we only summarize the main insights we have found so far on the dataset.
